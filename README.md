hackbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started.

### Duplicating Repo  

You will need [Git][git] to make a duplicate of this repository. 

move to a new directory  
% mkdir hackbot  
% cd hackbot   
  
Make a bare clone of the repository  
% git clone --bare https://github.com/GridIron/hack-a-thon.git  
 
Mirror-push to your new repository  
% cd hack-a-thon.git  
% git push --mirror https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git   

Remove our temporary local repository  
% cd ..  
% rm -rf hack-a-thon.git     

Now you can make a clone of your new repo  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git  

Once you have duplicated this repository. You will need to install [nodejs][nodejs] and [npm][npm] if you haven't already, to get Hubot working. Click the links to download and follow instructions on how to install these tools.

Now you should be able to run your bot locally

### Running hackbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following in the top level of your repo

You can start hackbot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379

Once output has stalled, push enter to generate the following prompt if it is not already present

Then you can interact with hackbot by typing `hackbot help`.

    hackbot> hackbot help
    hackbot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    hackbot help - Displays all of the help commands that hackbot knows about.
    ...

### Heroku Integration
You need to install the [Heroku toolbelt][herokut]. Click the link to download and follow the instructions to get this tool. Once this is installed, you will need to make an account with [heroku][herokuaccount] and verify your account. Then do the following in the top level of your repo (Windows users may need to restart their terminal before using Heroku commands):  

% heroku login  
% heroku create my-slackbot-appname  
% heroku config:add HEROKU_URL=http://my-slackbot-appname.herokuapp.com

###Slack Integration
Now one you will need to integrate your hackbot with [Slack][slack] and set some environment
variables. Create an account, create a team, then visit https://yourteamname.slack.com/services/new/hubot to add the Hubot capability. Then you will be presented with an API token. Use this token in the following terminal command:
  
% heroku config:add HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=please-place-your-token-here  

Now deploy your bot to heroku

% git push heroku master   

More detailed documentation can be found on the [deploying hubot onto
Heroku][deploy-heroku] wiki page. If you run into any problems, checkout Heroku's [docs][heroku-node-docs].  

[herokut]: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/ 
[slack]: https://slack.com/
[herokuaccount]: https://www.heroku.com/

Now your hackbot should be working fully in your slack team.
